                            <p>&emsp; A city tour in Nepal is an enthralling excursion through its important historical and
                                cultural sites, providing visitors with an insight into the nation's illustrious past and thriving urban culture.
                                The capital of Nepal, Kathmandu, is a well-liked place to begin such journeys.
                                Visit Kathmandu's Durbar Square, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, to see magnificent palaces, temples, and artistically carved buildings that recall the city's former regal era.
                                With its well-preserved medieval architecture, bustling town square, and lively street life, the historic city of Bhaktapur nearby transports you back in time.

                            <p>&emsp; Patan, formerly known as Lalitpur, is a vital stop on a city tour and is recognized for its stunning Newar architecture, museums, and active arts scene.
                                Durbar Square, a treasure trove of temples, shrines, and palace complexes, is the city's most well-known landmark. The Kathmandu Valley, a center for Nepali culture and history, is made up of Bhaktapur, Patan, and Kathmandu.
